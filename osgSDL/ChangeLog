- Fixed some compiler warnings

This release includes:
- Linux build files
- runOnce(), which allows you to use your own main loop instead of 
  osgSDL's run()
- a change to how input events are handled.  All queued SDL events are 
  processed every time runOnce() is called.  This prevents events from 
  backlogging, which in turn prevents the mouse input events from "lagging 
  behind" and creating the appearance of a sluggish interface.
- Spaceball support is now optional.  I'm still working on making this a 
  compile-time option which can be set when you run the configure script.
