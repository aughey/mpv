History of revision changes:
----------------------------

Version 1.0 - Minor tweak to the initialization code that makes the
              Spaceball 4000 FLX happier.  Lots of documentation updates.

Version 0.5 - First support for Spaceball 3000, 3003, and 4000 FLX models
              The code passively auto-detects what model device it is by 
              the types of packets it receives.

Version 0.1 - First public release of Libsball. (01/23/99)
              Based heavily on LibOrb, with various improvements that
              are spaceball specific.  Only supported Spaceball 2003.
