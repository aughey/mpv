Libsball development and debugging credits:
-----------------------------------------

John E. Stone (j.stone@acm.org) 
  Original author and present maintainer of Libsball.

Bill Sherman (wsherman@ncsa.uiuc.edu)
  He loaned me a Spaceball the night I wrote this.

All other credits go to the contributors to the original LibOrb 
project, as this library is based heavily on my LibOrb work.
