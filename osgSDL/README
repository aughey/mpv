osgSDL is a simple library that can be used to create an OpenGL rendering
context for use with applications based on the Open Scene Graph library. It is 
also used to handle input events, such as key presses, mouse clicks, etc. This 
library uses SDL  to create the rendering context and handle input events. 
This library is useful as an alternative to using GLUT or Producer, and is 
mainly of interest to Open Scene Graph application developers.

To compile this library, you'll need:
SDL - www.libsdl.org
OSG - www.openscenegraph.org

Compilation instructions (Windows):
==================================
The project files are for VC6, but I don't think OSG works with anything older 
than VC7.  Compilation should be no different from compiling any other VC 
project.  


Compilation instructions (Linux):
==================================
- Make sure you have SDL and OSG installed
- Run "./configure" and "make"
- As root, run "make install" and "ldconfig"

Usage (Linux):
==============
When compiling a program that uses osgSDL, you don't have to figure out 
which -L and -I and -l options to use.  You can have the "pkg-config" program 
figure this out for you.  To get a list of -I options, run: 
"pkg-config --cflags osgSDL"

To get a list of -L and -l options, run: 
"pkg-config --libs osgSDL"

You can run pkg-config directly from your "make" scripts if you use the 
backtick notation (this character: `).

Note: If you installed osgSDL in /usr/local (the default) you may need to do 
some extra work to get pkg-config to work with libraries in /usr/local.  You'll 
need to add "/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/" to your $PKG_CONFIG_PATH environmental 
variable.  

If you have "library not found" problems when running programs linked against 
osgSDL, make sure that /usr/local/lib is listed in your /etc/ld.so.conf file.


History:
========
osgSDL was written by Marco Jez. Marco doesn't maintain osgSDL any more, so 
I asked him if it was OK to take over maintenance for the library. He agreed, 
so here it is.  The original web page for osgSDL was: 
http://web.tiscali.it/areavr/osg/

Changes from the original version include:
- Linux build files are now included.  This library originally included 
  Visual Studio build files only.  
- Spaceball support is now optional.  I'm still working on making this a 
  compile-time option which can be set when you run the configure script.
- osgSDL can now be used without using the provided "main loop".  If your 
  program has its own main loop, just call osgSDL's runOnce() instead of 
  run().  The runOnce() function will process input events, render the 
  scene, and return (instead of running forever).  The run() function behaves 
  just like it always has.


Future Plans:
=============
- I'd like to put together an example program that makes use of osgSDL, to 
  get people started quickly.
- I'd like to document osgSDL a bit.
