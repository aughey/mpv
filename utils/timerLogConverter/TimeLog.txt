The timing output files generated by the ExecLengthTiming plugin are in a 
binary format that is not readable by other programs.  

TimeLog is a utility for converting ExecLengthTiming's timing output files 
into Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files.

CSV files can be used by most spreadsheet applications, including Excel and 
OpenOffice.  With some work, they can also be used by graph plotting programs, 
such as gnuplot.

This utility is written in C++, and has no external dependencies.  It works on 
Windows and Linux.  There is a project file for VC++, as well as a build script 
for Linux.

This utility is part of the Multi-Purpose Viewer project.

Usage:

(program name) [input file]

"input file" is an optional argument, specifying the binary log file to load 
and process.  The default file name, "tmr_bin.log", is used if no file is 
specified.

The output will be stored in "tmr_txt.csv"
