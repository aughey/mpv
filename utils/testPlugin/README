MPV uses the LTDL library to load plugins.  Unfortunately, the LTDL library 
gives horrible, misleading error messages when a plugin fails to load.

This utility will load the shared library file specified on the command line 
using the dlopen() mechanism.  Any errors will be printed to the console.
These error messages are much more useful than those issued by LTDL.  This 
allows you to find errors in your plugin which are otherwise difficult 
to diagnose using the MPV.

This utility uses dlopen(), so it is a Linux-specific utility.  Windows is 
better about reporting unresolved symbols in plugins, so Windows users will 
probably not need a utility like this anyway.

Note - Don't forget to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the directories 
where your MPV libraries are located (libmpvcommon, etc).  Also, you need 
to give the *full* path name of the plugin library.  

Example:
./testPluginUtil /junk/mpv/mpv/pluginEntityMgr/.libs/libpluginEntityMgr.so
