//fixme - the ParticleSystemUpdater documentation says that we need to add the 
// ParticleSystemUpdater *after* any emitters and programs, but I'm not sure 
// we can guarantee that with our node heirarchy...

maybe we could make sure that the "world space" branch off of our entity 
branch is added first, and that all subsequent additions to the entity branch 
are made to the beginning of the list in the entity branch
