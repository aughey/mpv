In short, you can use this software as you see fit, provided that:

- you do not charge anyone for this software
- you do not claim that you wrote this software
- if you make changes to this software, you MUST release the source code for 
  those changes to ANYONE who receives a copy of the modified software.  If 
  you release your modified version to one of your customers, then you must

We are currently (circa 2007) in the process of changing the licensing to 
allow vendors to create commercial plugins.  The license for various plugins 
has been changed from the GPL to the less-restrictive LGPL.  However, the 
majority of the MPV's components, including the common lib, are still licensed 
under the GPL.
