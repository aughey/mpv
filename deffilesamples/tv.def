// This def file contains settings for the pluginRenderTV plugin.
// pluginRenderTV will capture video from a TV tuner card (or similar 
// device; anything supported by Video4Linux should work) and place the 
// output in a texture.  That texture is applied to a quad, which is 
// placed in the background of the scene.
// 
// To use this plugin to develop a poor-man's augmented reality system, you 
// should disable your sky (pluginRenderSkyOSG or pluginRenderEphemerisOSG) 
// and terrain (pluginRenderTerrainOSG) plugins.  On the Host side, you'll 
// need some way to feed in entity telemetry and video, and keep the two 
// synchronized.  Good luck.

	// resolution matches width X textureheight.  The texture coordinates for 
	// the quad will be adjusted so that the top width X height portion of the 
	// texture is stretched to fill the quad.  
	// width and textureheight must be powers of 2.  height does not
	// have that requirement, but should probably correspond to one of the 
	// vertical resolutions that your tuner card can capture at.
